## Hi there 👋 I'm Ahmed , a professional business intelligence analyst.

Results-driven Competitive Intelligence and Market Analyst with over 7 years of experience leveraging data analytics to drive strategic decision-making and business growth. Proficient in SQL, Tableau, advanced Spreadsheets modeling, Cohort Analysis and Retention and Churn Analysis. Expertise in optimizing marketing and product Funnels through comprehensive data interpretation, competitive analysis, and market trend forecasting.

After completing my master's degree I embarked on a career as a pricing, market research and market intelligence specialist in one of the biggest companies in telecommunication industry. With collective research budget of EGP 5M back in 2013, I led the market research function to study the market dynamics, gather and analyze the data to feed the strategic planning, product development and marketing communication departments with the needed information. Using this information, we were able to restructure our products portfolio to come up with new products which resulted in 10% increase in company's revenues.

This experience made me realize the power of data and the significant impact it can have on businesses and processes. Motivated by this realization, I made the decision to specialize in business intelligence analysis field. 

While pursuing another college degree was not a feasible option for me at the time, I sought out a practical alternative to acquire the necessary skills. That’s when I discovered the TripleTen BIA program, an immersive 4-months bootcamp that perfectly aligned with my aspirations.

During the program, I delved deep into the realms of SQL, Data Visualization using Tableau and PowerBI, Business and User Metrics and Cohort and Funnel Analysis. Collaborating with fellow students on over 10 study projects, we tackled real-world business cases, utilizing data to drive improvements and achieve tangible results.
